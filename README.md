# authMongoExpress

**authMongoExpress** is a web-based MongoDB administration interface built using Node.js and Express. This application provides a user-friendly interface to manage MongoDB databases, collections, and documents efficiently.

## Features

- **Database Management**: Create, view, and delete databases.
- **Collection Management**: Add, rename, and delete collections within databases.
- **Document Management**: Insert, update, and delete documents in collections.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access to the interface with user authentication mechanisms.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage and retrieval.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karan5772/authMongoExpress.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd authMongoExpress
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the variables like:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=
   SESSION_SECRET=
   PORT=
   BASE_ADDRESS=
   ```

   - `MONGO_URI`: Connection string for your MongoDB instance.
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret key for session management.
   - `PORT`: Port number where  the server runs.
   - `BASE_ADDRESS`: Gives the base address of the application.

5. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

1. **Access the Interface**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Authenticate**:

   Log in using your credentials. If no users are set up, refer to the [User Management](#user-management) section.

3. **Manage Databases and Collections**:

   Use the interface to create, view, and manage databases and their respective collections.

4. **Perform CRUD Operations**:

   Within collections, you can create, read, update, and delete documents as needed.

## User Management

To add or manage users for authentication:

1. **Access the User Collection**:

   In your MongoDB database, navigate to the `users` collection.

2. **Insert a New User**:

   Ensure that passwords are securely hashed before storing them. You can use libraries like `bcrypt` to hash passwords before inserting them into the database.
